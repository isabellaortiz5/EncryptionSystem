FROM FAIREST CREATURES WE DESIRE INCREASE, THAT THEREBY BEAUTY'S ROSE 
MIGHT NEVER DIE, BUT AS THE RIPER SHOULD BY TIME DECEASE, HIS TENDER 
HEIR MIGHT BEAR HIS MEMORY: BUT THOU CONTRACTED TO THINE OWN BRIGHT 
EYES, FEED'ST THY LIGHT'S FLAME WITH SELF-SUBSTANTIAL FUEL, MAKING A 
FAMINE WHERE ABUNDANCE LIES, THY SELF THY FOE, TO THY SWEET SELF TOO 
CRUEL: THOU THAT ART NOW THE WORLD'S FRESH ORNAMENT, AND ONLY HERALD 
TO THE GAUDY SPRING, WITHIN THINE OWN BUD BURIEST THY CONTENT, AND 
TENDER CHURL MAK'ST WASTE IN NIGGARDING: PITY THE WORLD, OR ELSE THIS 
GLUTTON BE, TO EAT THE WORLD'S DUE, BY THE GRAVE AND THEE. 
WHEN FORTY WINTERS SHALL BESIEGE THY BROW, AND DIG DEEP TRENCHES IN 
THY BEAUTY'S FIELD, THY YOUTH'S PROUD LIVERY SO GAZED ON NOW, WILL BE A 
TATTERED WEED OF SMALL WORTH HELD: THEN BEING ASKED, WHERE ALL THY 
BEAUTY LIES, WHERE ALL THE TREASURE OF THY LUSTY DAYS; TO SAY WITHIN 
THINE OWN DEEP SUNKEN EYES, WERE AN ALL-EATING SHAME, AND THRIFTLESS 
PRAISE.
